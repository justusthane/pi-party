okay, just got the pi zero w.

did some googling.

it looks like i'll need a keyboard, mouse, and screen to play with the pi - i wonder if i can beam it to my laptop, or i need a whole separate screen.

i think the next step is to set up the os using the raspberry pi imager: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/

i installed raspberry pi os lite (32-bit), which i'm pretty sure is the raspbian fork of debian without any desktop windowing or gui stuff. it's less than 500mb and i hope light on the processor.

something from the pi website: a command to install the pi imager within the pi os: sudo apt install rpi-imager. my god, they're learning how to replicate themselves. nature, uh, finds a way.

i've got a small tubular rechargable battery. i'm sure it's just some airport kiosk junk but i bet it'll work well for now. if it is a good specimen, i could make the raspberry jam into a long sceptre of raw bluetooth power.

following the instructions on https://www.techcoil.com/blog/how-to-use-a-raspberry-pi-zero-w/ i am making an ssh file and a wpa_supplicant.conf file to connect to wifi and ssh into the pi. i have no idea how to do any of those things so we'll just see how this plays out.

okay, i found a tutorial at https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2017/04/manually-setting-up-pi-wifi-using-wpa_supplicant-conf/ which has some sample code for connecting to wifi networks. let's see if it works...

it's making blinkies with the green LED...

pinging...

"ping request could not find host raspberry pi"

shit.

found it!! from https://www.shellhacks.com/find-raspberry-pi-ip-on-network-windows-macos-linux/ i learned that the MAC address for a pi starts with either B8:27:EB or DC:A6:32. using the "arp -a" terminal command i found it and pinged it. my google-fu is strong this saturday.

so, i just tried to ssh into the pi and i got a "port 22: connection refused" error. yeesh

oh, i just looked at https://phoenixnap.com/kb/enable-ssh-raspberry-pi and it says that the ssh filename should just be "ssh". i think i made the filename ".ssh". i'll change it now.

baddabing baddaboom. i'm having fun today.

WE'RE IN !!!

okay... now what?

"sudo raspi-config" gave me some options for setup. i changed the ssh password.

the "python" command opened up a shell. B^) we hacking now

okay, so apparently using a command like "scp -r /python-apps pi@192.168.x.xxx:~/" securely copies files over to the pi. i don't know much about daemons but this tutorial says they run 24/7, and using "systemd" (what's that?) i can make daemons. cool.

now i'm navigating around, first using the "cd /" command to go to the root folder. whee!

good tutorial on navigating around with the pi running raspbian: https://retroresolution.com/2015/12/12/navigating-the-raspberry-pis-file-system-raspbian-linux-shell-commands-and-tools-part-2/

now to the bluetooth experimentation. looking at https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/04/17/starting-with-raspberry-pi-bluetooth-python-python-bluetooth-raspberrypi-piday-raspberry_pi/ i am starting to apt-get the python libraries needed for bluetooth connectivity

had to install pip through https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ first... waiting waiting waiting for my "python get-pip.py" command to follow through...

decided to look at https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/software/python.md and used the "sudo apt install python3-pip" instead. i navigated to the "/" folder of the pi - i hope that is in the PATH or whatever. not sure about folders like bin and var and usr - what are they used for, are they suggestions or do they have hardcoded permissions?

an answer: https://serverfault.com/questions/24523/meaning-of-directories-on-unix-and-unix-like-systems good to know /usr stands for "unix system resources" and NOT user... i woulda started filling that with all my junk

this is going to be important: https://raspberrytips.com/raspberry-pi-commands/

okay, i made a directory for the project: /home/jam. nice. okay, also we just learned that nano is a text editor. cool.

the speaker i have at home has the address 30:23:37:CD:3B:B4. let's see if we can connect

hmmm... looking at https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-bluetooth/ i think i need some help with the ol how-the-hell-does-bluetooth-work...

okay, installing pyaudio on the recommendation of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20760589/list-all-audio-devices-with-pythons-pyaudio-portaudio-binding, which has some example code to list audio devices. maybe after pairing a bluetooth speaker will show up on this list?

also using pip to install sounddevice, a library for connecting to sound devices. am i already bloating my pi? bah. i am having fun.
